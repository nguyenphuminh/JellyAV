# JellyAV
A small, experimental antivirus program written in Batch

## How does it work?
Basically, it get the hash from a file and then compare it with a bunch of hashes inside the database. If it's in the database, then it'll be counted as a virus and get deleted.

There's some utilities too, but basically that's how JellyAV works.

## Should I use this as my primary AV tool?
Heck no!

First of all, this is not a serious project, this is an experimental project just to show how I created a crappy antivirus in Batch. Second of all, this antivirus only works will pre-existing hashes in the database, when encountering a new born malware, it'll not work at all. Furthermore, the database is not even that big, so you'll probably still be infected with old-ass viruses.

However, if you're a Batch developer or a crappy scripter like me, then you can try it out and build your own thing if you want :)

## Resources
I took the database from [here](https://github.com/anic17/Batch-Antivirus), be sure to check them out!

## Note
Ironically, you should turn off your already existing antivirus software as Batch files are marked as malicious, and run JellyAV as administrator for it to work properly.
